//  what is window object 

//  let understand first browser context api => 
    
    //  --> window object  
    //  --> Stack
    //  --> HeapMemory


//  window object gives us a feature that JS don't have init like alert, Prompt, print etc. 
//  for example if we need to prompt something on browser using js but js don't have a feature of prompt so js request to browser window's object that contain prompt property. That's how window object works.
